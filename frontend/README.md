# Frontend

Web Interface for Daily and Weekly Digest.

### Best Practices
- https://react.dev/
- https://maxrozen.com/guidelines-improve-react-app-folder-structure
- https://vite.dev/
- https://tailwindcss.com/


### Tech Stack Choices

- React + TypeScript → safe, scalable, strongly typed.
- Vite → fast dev server and build tool (lighter than CRA).
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui → modern styling, reusable components.
- React Query + Zustand → API state management + local UI state.

### Roadmap
- Allow interaction with items: mark, highlight, categorize, or export to Obsidian.
- Handle feedback submission (for RLHF / ranking).
- Possibly provide a mini media player for YouTube/podcast previews.
- Optionally support notifications or scheduled views.

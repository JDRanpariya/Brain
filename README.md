### Consumption Sources
- [ ] Personal Youtube Subscriptions
- [ ] Research Papers
  - [ ] arXiv Sanity Preserver to track ML related papers
  - [ ] Use PubMed Alerts, Google Scholar Alerts, and Semantic Scholar for neuroscience, biology, and anthropology.
  - [ ] Explore Services like Zotero, Paperpile, and Mendeley can help organize relevant papers.
  - [ ] AI based Filtering and clustering and abstract summarization.
    - [ ] AI-assisted Abstract Summarization and Relevance Scoring
    - [ ] Train an LLM (like GPT) on papers you find interesting to generate scores for relevance.
    - [ ] Use embeddings (like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002) to vectorize abstracts and compare them to abstracts you previously liked.
  - [ ] Tracking Research Trends Over Time???
  - [ ] Follow leading researchers on Google Scholar and ResearchGate to track influential publications??

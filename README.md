**Fully Open Source Personalized Content Streamer**

## üöÄ Minimal MVP Roadmap (4‚Äì6 weeks)

### Week 0: Repo + Infra
- Scaffold monorepo (backend, frontend, connectors)  
- Docker Compose environment  
- Postgres + Redis + MinIO  

### Week 1‚Äì2: Ingestion + Storage
- Implement 3 connectors (RSS, YouTube, newsletters via Mailgun webhook or IMAP parsing)  
- Parse ‚Üí clean ‚Üí store core schema + raw content  
- Add transcript extraction for YouTube/podcasts  

### Week 2‚Äì3: Embeddings + Basic UI
- Hook in embedding model, store vectors in pgvector  
- Build simple React UI showing daily digest from last 24h  
- Add Obsidian export endpoint  

### Week 3‚Äì4: Feedback & Ranking
- Add explicit feedback API (save, highlight + reason)  
- Basic ranking: recency + source weight + embedding similarity  

### Week 4+: Iterate
- Add Celery tasks  
- Scheduled digest generation  
- Analytics dashboard  
- Begin gathering feedback for Phase 1 ML  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Danger Zones & Mitigations

- **RLHF too early** ‚Üí wait for high-signal feedback (‚â• 500 explicit examples)  
- **Over-indexing content** ‚Üí prune old vectors, compress, or store reduced embeddings  
- **Connector maintenance** ‚Üí build adapters + monitoring/tests per connector

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist to Start Coding (Actionable)

- [ ] Initialize repo + Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis, MinIO)  
- [ ] Define DB schema (users, sources, items, interactions, feedback)  
- [ ] Implement RSS & YouTube fetchers + HTML ‚Üí Markdown parser  
- [ ] Add sentence-transformers embedding job and pgvector integration  
- [ ] Build FastAPI endpoints for digest and feedback  
- [ ] Minimal React UI to view digest, mark likes/highlights, export to Obsidian

# TODO
- [ ] Use [YT Api](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to get videos uploaded by my subscribed channels yesterday.
  - [X] get list of all channels and store it in db
  - [ ] For each channel get videos uploaded yesterday/last 24 hours.
- [ ] Setup .env and find out ways to show the data in neat format
- [ ] on hover it should play the video in small frame
- [ ] on shortcut it should go to my obsidian with resource template, add to weekly review as well
- [ ] Figure out consumption sources

### Consumption Sources
- [ ] Move this to Ingetion Layer
- [ ] Personal Youtube Subscriptions
- [ ] Research Papers
  - [ ] arXiv Sanity Preserver to track ML related papers
  - [ ] Use PubMed Alerts, Google Scholar Alerts, and Semantic Scholar for neuroscience, biology, and anthropology.
  - [ ] Explore Services like Zotero, Paperpile, and Mendeley can help organize relevant papers.
  - [ ] AI based Filtering and clustering and abstract summarization.
    - [ ] AI-assisted Abstract Summarization and Relevance Scoring
    - [ ] Train an LLM (like GPT) on papers you find interesting to generate scores for relevance.
    - [ ] Use embeddings (like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002) to vectorize abstracts and compare them to abstracts you previously liked.
  - [ ] Tracking Research Trends Over Time???
  - [ ] Follow leading researchers on Google Scholar and ResearchGate to track influential publications??
